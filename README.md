### Hi there 👋

I'm a full stack developer from Nanjing, China 🇨🇳. I'm 34 years old and has been coding professionally for 7 years.

I use a few programming languages (Ruby, Javascript/Typescript, Python, Rust, and Golang) to talk to computer. Though constantly changing, the primary framework I will use for new project is still Ruby on Rails.

### My toolbox

I used a few tools/apps for my daily usage and development, generally I would like to stick to one platform and use the native solution whenever possible.

📫 **E-mail**

Primary: iCloud + Hotmail

Alternative: Gmail for Google account setup mainly, so many junk mails there and no way to cleanup.

👁️ **Anonymous**

Primary: [Hide my email](https://www.apple.com/sg/icloud/) from iCloud (Requires iCloud+)

Alternative: Duckduckgo email protection and Firefox email relay service

🗄️ **VPN**

Primary: [ExpressVPN](https://www.expressvpn.com) for AppleTV and macbook, iPhone

Alternative: Shadowsocks with accounts purchased from [conyss](https://conyss.uk)

㊙️ **Password manager**

Primary: iCloud keychain (Apple products only)

Note: Used to have [1Password](https://1password.com), dropped it as it is a paid app and compared with native iCloud keychain, it doesn't offer much addtional value to me (I use primary Apple products iPhone + Mac). Also tried [ExpressVPN Keys](https://www.expressvpn.com/keys) for a while, the function is too simple and geniuely not easy to use, not to mention that it only supports Google Chrome.

📓 **Knowledge base**

Primary: [Logseq](https://logseq.com), the cross platform sync solution is based on iCloud.

Alternative: Notion + iCloud notes

🏄‍♂️ **Browser**

Primary: Safari (So I could use native password manager easily), [Firefox focus](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/focus/) is also used on iOS, which is used as an ad blocker extension.

Alternative: Chrome + Firefox, both offers great profile switch function.

☁️ **Domain registration**

Primary: [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
